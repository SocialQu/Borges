# 1. Introduction

Word embeddings are used in almost every commercial application that involves AI and human language. Some examples applications include search engines, social media recommendation algorithms, language translation, speech recognition, market reasearch, automated trading and language generation [[1]]().

This course is based on the Stanford's [CS224 course](), it's directed to Software Engineers that lack the time or mathematical background to gain an intuitive understanding of this technology as presented in the Stanford [Video Lectures]().

My goal for the course is to present the information as simple and intuitive as possible. I do not avoid mathematics, but I try to simplify them to the point of only the using elemental mathematics to support the proccess of developing and understaning behind this concepts. Additionaly, I've enabled an interface to play, test and experiment with the concepts through different applications. 

*Warning for Stanford Students:* Based on the [honor code](), if your are in the process of delivering the first assignment I advice you not to continue forward with this course. Having said that, I would love to hear your feedback, you can connect with me at [LinkedIn](), [GitHub](), or [Twitter]().
