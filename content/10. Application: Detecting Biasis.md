# 10. Application: Detecting Biases

A more useful application of word embeddings is detecting biases. The concepts are similar, find two opposites like man and woman, and measure how different are closer to each other. For example, in terms of jobs we can find which are more commonly held by a man than a woman and visceversa. 

Similar concepts can be made with Sentiment Analysis, and measure if there is a bias against a particular group or person. And it can also be used to moderate content: if we detect that nocive comments usually fall within a particular region of the vector space composed by the word embeddings, we can flag that content and review it manually.
