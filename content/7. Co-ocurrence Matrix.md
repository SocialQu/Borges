# 7. Co-ocurrence Matrix

The second step involves finding adyacent words, and mapping this relationships in a Matrix. The first step is to enlist every unique word in our corpus (text dataset). Once defined, we will build a square matrix where each column and row represents a word.

Next, define an N-sized window, where every word that is at most N words appart is considered adjacent like this:

```
// For an 3 sized window:

const str = 'I enjoy learning about Natural Language Proccesing.'

// enjoy & learning are adyacent.
// enjoy & about are adyacent.
// enjoy & Natural are adyacent.
// enjoy & Language are *NOT* adyacent.

```

For our case we are going to use a 5 word window and based on the text you submitted, this is how your co-occurrence matrix looks:
