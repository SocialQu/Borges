    <p>
        Word embeddings are numerical representations of a word's meaning. 
        They are formed based on the assumption that meaning is contextual. 
        That is, a word's meaning is dependant on its neighbors:

    />

    <p>
        <i>For example, if the word "ice" usually appears next to "water", one could infer that both words have a similar meaning.</i>

    <p>
        Word embeddings are represented as mathematical vectors. 
        This representation enables to perform standard mathematical operations in words, like addition and subtraction.Â

    />

    <p>        
        These operations have interesting applications in language, like finding synonyms, classifying documents, or recommending content. 
        Additionally, 2-dimensional vectors can be plotted to produce a visual understanding of a document or a person's language.
